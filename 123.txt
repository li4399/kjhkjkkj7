Theres no doubt that my mother gives all her love to me. I do believe she is a great person who makes my life beautiful and meaningful.　　She is an easygoing and kind woman with bright eyes and a lovely smile. Although she is often busy, I still feel that I am taken good care of by her. Its a great pleasure to chat with her when I get into troubles. She always encourages me not to give up and tries to cheer me up by coming up with good solutions. In addition, I am fascinated by her cooking and writing.　　With her love, I feel like a fish swimming happily in a beautiful sea. Ill cherish her love forever.
My teacher, Miss Wang, helped me a lot in my middle school life. She is a kind easygoing woman. I must thank her for making a confident girl.　　I used to be a shy and unconfident girl. Mrs. Wang noticed me. She took good care of me and encouraged me to join the school speech contest. Of course, I failed. But Mrs. Wang cheered me up and said every man is the architect of his own future.　　From then on, I practiced every day. It goes without saying “No pain, no gain.” I won the contest in the second term. In my opinion, teachers are the same as gardeners and they volunteer today and gain tomorrow. Not only can they teach knowledge but also they can teach students how to be a successful man.　　Thank you, Mrs. Wang. You make a duck become a beautiful swan. I want to be a teacher that as same as you in the future.
